- 👋 Hi, I’m @JosePerezYoel
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything related to programming. My first language is Python but I'm also fluent in JavaScript and have taken college classes in Java and C#. I like finding ways on how to make code that I've written more efficient and want to keep practicing on writing code that is elegant and easy to read.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack web development with a focus on back-end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web app projects and maybe even expand into mobile app development.
